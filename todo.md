Goals:
5. add jito bundle to service
   - TDD -> jito module, bundle, buy bundle, sell bundle ( check that example with bulldoze and bundle generation)
 - ^ if theres a better flow for this do that
 - https://github.com/jito-labs/jito-ts, HOW DO I TEST THIS?
6. add jito bundle to API
7. move the mass wallet code fixtures from the jito test, to a wallet service files, should be distribute.ts and reclaim.ts with tests for each, and add endpoints for that, make sure they use wallet labels
8. Test API V1, good copy finish. above should be enough for a bot
  -  pumpfun launch
  -  wallets

Future
- Volume bot
- KEEEP CHANGES SIMPLE, we want backend to be flexible
