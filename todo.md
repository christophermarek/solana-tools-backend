- add users and whitelist tables and repository 
- add ownership for wallets, bots, track executions by user

- test entire ownership

- add api key for api calls (only our telegram client)

   - simple Volume bot
2. Estimate Volume bot fees
3. Test API V1, good copy finish. above should be enough for a bot
  -  pumpfun launch
